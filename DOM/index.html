Introduction to DOM(Document Object Module)


Every component of a document is a node. The document itself is a document node, every HTML element is an element node, text inside HTML elements is text nodes, and so on.

For selecting elements
document.getElementById(id): Selects an element by its ID.
document.getElementsByClassName(className): Selects elements by their class name.
document.getElementsByTagName(tagName): Selects elements by their tag name.
document.querySelector(selector): Selects the first element that matches a CSS selector.
document.querySelectorAll(selector): Selects all elements that match a CSS selector.
